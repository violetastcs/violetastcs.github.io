<hr>
<p>Cases of gang stalking - the organized stalking of an individual by a group of people - are regularly disregarded as delusion, <em>"targeted individuals"</em> are lebeled <em>"schizos"</em> and as insane. It is all put down simply to people being paranoid or <em>"mentally ill"</em>. But, then, why is the phenomenon of gang stalking such a recent phenomenon? Of course, with the notable exception of East Germany, gang stalking is very much a thing of the past 20 years! It isn't something Schizophrenics have raved about for centuries. Not only this, but plenty of seemingly normal people, without any hint of experiecing psychosis, report experiencing gang stalking.</p>
<p>But, of course, it's all just mere <em>"delusion"</em>, at least according to those who control the psychiatric institutions that keep us in check.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, French postmodernist and poststructuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari collaborated on potentially one of the most important works of postmodern philosophy; <em>“Anti-Oepidus”</em>, the first part of the two-volume <em>“Capitalism and Schizophrenia”</em>. In <em>“Anti-Oepidus”</em>, Deleuze and Guattari talk of Capitalism inducing a <em>“Schizophrenic”</em> worldview, one that conflates the view of the physical body, the mind, the ideological, the political, and the material conditions of the world. Deleuze believed this <em>“Schizophrenic”</em> lense could be useful.</p>
<p>This worldview is best, and perhaps most humerously, shown by Guattari through the case of Mr. Daniel Schreber. Mr Schreber, a German judge in the 1800s, suffered from what we now know as Paranoid Schizophrenia. In his memoirs, which were analyzed by Guattari, he speaks of his stomach being stolen by Aliens and replaced with an inferior Jewish stomach every lunchtime, and so he would never eat the lunch he was offered at the psych ward in which he resided. This, Guattari argued, was a great example of the Schizophrenic lense; it conflates the physical body (his stomach), the ideological (Judaism), and the material conditions of the world (the existence of Aliens).</p>
<p>So then, how does this relate to gang stalking? To understand this, we must first view society in a different lense to how we are brought up to think of it. Instead of viewing society as a a collection of individuals, we must view society as a machine. Much as the human being can be divided into into cells, which are all effectively tiny machines for processing input and producing output which together produce a much more complex machine, we must view society as a machine, which can be divided into many human machines.</p>
<p>The inputs and outputs of these many human <em>“cells”</em> in society are spread via memes - an idea or style that spreads via immitation in a group of people - a term coined by Richard Dawkins in <em>“The Selfish Gene”</em>. While in the modern era we think of memes in a very different sense, they are fundamentally the same thing, and spread in the same manner, though the term can be applied much more generally to comparatively esoteric or subtle ideas. Through memetics - the study of information in culture through a Darwinian lense - we can model society’s evolution. Societies evolve through random mutations, and those random mutations that project themselves the most effectively are the ones that take hold.</p>
<p>From the earliest of human civilization to right before the Dawn of Modernity, society’s evolution was slow. Mutations were few and far between, and due to the time scale of empires of the time, it took a long time for mutations to prove themselves effective. However, in the 1700s with the Dawn of Modernity, something else happened. Through random mutations of the Feudal sytsem of the United Kingdom, a new system was born: Capitalism.</p>
<p>This new capitalist system, with it’s privatized industry, decentralized governance, and placing the merchant over the lord, fundamentally altered society’s evolution. The new system produced entities which would thrive or fall in a matter of years, not decades, in the form of businesses. Mutations happen potentially hundreds of times faster than before, with the most profitable mutations now being given more resources to build itself up, put money towards further mutation, and to project itself. As Nick Land rather poetically puts it in <a href="https://vastabrupt.com/2018/08/15/ideology-intelligence-and-capital-nick-land/">an interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote> You have a pile of radioactive rods that are damped down by graphite containment rods, and you start pulling out those graphite rods, and at a certain point it goes critical and you get an explosion.</blockquote>
<p>Compared to the slow growth of old European systems, the new capitalist system conquered the world in but a few centuries after that. With the new global stage, and unfathomable resources at it’s hands, the capitalist system had mutated in such a way to hack into our psychology to exploit it for maximal gain. Capitalism begins to produce a Schizophrenic worldview across society, allowing for humanity to better recognize patterns in threats to business and capital, and also better understand subtle signals given off by other humans, widening the amount of information that could be spread via memes.</p>
<p>By opening up people’s ability to analyze their surroundings and make connections between things that were seemingly unrelated before, people could now - consciously or not - see patterns in human behaviour that would lead to damage to profits.</p>
<p>When society notices these threats, profit motives lead to pieces of information about these new dangers being spread far and wide. The societal intelligence spreads patterns to look out for and instructs people to experience a feeling of fear or disgust when we see these patterns. Motivated by these feelings, societies begin to cloesly monitor these threats. Through capitalism’s manufactured paranoia, unwanted elements are blocked from spreading their genes, whether in the literal, genetic sense of genes, or in the form of cultural genes (memes). To more effectively prevent the spread of these genes, people who fit these patterns are actively prevented from participating in many day-to-day activities, or disuaded from them by means ranging from the most obvious physical and emotional threat, all the way down to, through memes, hammering the idea that they are worthless, or useless, or unwanted, into their mind.</p>
<p>This can range from the most conscious form of monitoring and prevention, in the form of police surveilance and neighbourhood watch groups, all the way down to individuals who, despite being used by capital to target these unwanted elements, are completely oblivious of what they are doing.</p>
<p>Through capitalism’s profit motive, societies implant patterns into our heads to look out for, and we as groups stalk those who embody these patterns, ensuring they don’t act out of line or spread their ideas further and damage profits.</p>
